## üöÄ Quick Start - Streamlit Cloud

### Deploy to Streamlit Cloud (Recommended)

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)**
3. **Sign in** with your GitHub account
4. **Click "New app"**
5. **Select your forked repository**
6. **Set the main file path**: `streamlit_app.py`
7. **Add Hugging Face Token** (see setup below)
8. **Click "Deploy"**

Your BintaBot will be live in minutes! üåç

### üîë Hugging Face Token Setup

BintaBot uses the Mistral-7B model which requires authentication. To set up your token:

1. **Get a Hugging Face Token:**
   - Go to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
   - Sign in or create an account
   - Click "New token"
   - Give it a name (e.g., "BintaBot")
   - Select "Read" permissions
   - Copy the token

2. **Add Token to Streamlit Cloud:**
   - In your Streamlit Cloud app settings
   - Go to "Secrets" section
   - Add this configuration:
   ```toml
   HF_TOKEN = "your_hugging_face_token_here"
   ```

3. **Alternative: Use Fallback Model**
   - If you don't want to set up a token, the app will automatically use a fallback model
   - The fallback model is open-access and doesn't require authentication
   - You'll still get cultural responses, though they may be less sophisticated

**Note**: The cloud version focuses on text-based cultural exchange. Voice features are available in the local version.

### Local Development (Full Features)

1. **Clone and setup environment:**
```bash
cd fatoubot
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Install system dependencies (macOS):**
```bash
# Install portaudio for microphone access
brew install portaudio

# Install cmake (if needed)
brew install cmake
```

4. **Set up Hugging Face Token (Optional):**
   - Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file
   - Add: `HF_TOKEN = "your_token_here"`
   - This enables the full Mistral-7B model locally

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Streamlit Cloud Issues

- **Fallback Model**: If Mistral-7B fails, the app automatically uses DialoGPT-medium
- **Voice features are not available** in cloud environment
- **Text chat will always work** with fallback responses
- Check deployment logs for errors
- Ensure all dependencies are properly specified

### Hugging Face Token Issues
- **Token not working**: Ensure token has "Read" permissions
- **Model access denied**: Accept the model terms on Hugging Face website
- **Token expired**: Generate a new token
- **Fallback mode**: The app will work with open-access models if token fails

### Local Voice Issues
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted
- Check if microphone is connected and working
- Try different microphone if available
- Install system dependencies (portaudio, cmake)

### Speech Recognition Errors
- Speak clearly and at normal volume
- Reduce background noise
- Check internet connection (Google API required)

### Text-to-Speech Issues
- Ensure speakers/headphones are connected
- Check system volume
- Try different voice settings in voice_utils.py

### Installation Issues
- Update pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
- Install system dependencies (portaudio, cmake)
- Use virtual environment to avoid conflicts
